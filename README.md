# About this project

The app porpouse is, show user the skills and victories of any player. I made a api request to show all this information on the screen. A interesting project resource is the dinamic progress bar. I could use Progress View, but i couldn't set a label (to show a number) inside the bar, because of it i had to create a dinamic progress bar, using StackView, Views and proportionality with multiplier.

I could practice some topics, such as: 
Autolayout
API Request
Viewcode
Some principles of SOLID
Clean Code
